This Is a repo for my homework assignment due on Saturday. 
* Refactoring Code Homework

## Description

* This is my first project as a home work assigment. This webstite and codde was given to us to refactor and edit the code so that it can look cleaner, be more accessible, and easier to read. This kind of work is imortant especially when working with teams of programmers who get to read you're code after you. It makes editing and adding code a lot faster and easier. Even after refactoring the code I learned how much more easy on the eyes it is to find every secition of the website. I also gave comments describing the chages and the functionality of the code keeping it simple and well explained.
