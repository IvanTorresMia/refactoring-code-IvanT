* Refactoring Code Homework

# Getting started

 * To start off this website contains a navigation bar which gives you links to different sections of the webstie, such as "Search enging Optimization, Social Media Markerting etc." Each section of the page will give you a desrcription of the topic. If you look to the side we have a side section that gives you more information on how to raise brand awareness, how this our company can help your business and how we can help save you money by working with us. 


## Description

* This is my first project as a homework assigment. This webstite and code was given to us to refactor and edit the code so that it can look cleaner, be more accessible, and easier to read. This kind of work is imortant especially when working with teams of programmers who get to read you're code after you. It makes editing and adding code a lot faster and easier. Even after refactoring the code I learned how much more easy on the eyes it is to find every secition of the website. I also gave comments describing the chages and the functionality of the code keeping it simple and well explained.
